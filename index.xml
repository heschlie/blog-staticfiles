      <description>Trying out Hugo for the blog Well I have had my eye on Hugo, a static site generator for some time now. It is written in Go, supports markdown, has a rich theme system, and as it says it generates html you can just drop in for nginx or whatever your webserver happens to be.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using hexo for some time now, and it has worked quite well, but I&amp;rsquo;m not fond of managing the Node dependencies, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know Javascript all too well so I wanted something that was both open source and written in a language I knew and could more easily contribute to.</description>

      <description>A Followup on the CR10S S5 So I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with the printer for about a week now. All of my planned upgrades have come in and some of them ended up not needing to be upgrades, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more in detail about that below. For those not wanting to read the whole article, the short of it is I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much dialed in the settings with the new extruder/hotend using 3mm filament, and I am impressed with the results.</description>

      <description>A brief overview of the CR10S-S5 Recently I decided one 3D printer was just not enough. I have no complaints about my first printer, an Ultimaker 2+, it creates some beautiful prints and does them quickly as well. However, I do every so often want to print bigger, which means multiple pieces and glue. So I had been keeping an eye out for a decent quality large volume printer, and my dreams came true!</description>

      <description>Link to Part 1
In this continuing series we&amp;rsquo;re setting up the hardware and installing Ubuntu to the HC2s.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get building! Get everything unboxed, and find yourself oddly pleased with how well the cases snap together to form your nice new tower. You can see here what they look like stacked, and you can see the barrel plugs I need to tie into my power supply.
I wired up the plugs to a single set of wires to make managing the easier.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a multi part blog series about setting up a Kubernetes cluster at home, on a budget. In this first post we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the why of this, and speccing out the hardware. I plan for this to be roughly equivalent to a production k8s deployment, using TLS/SSL, enforcing policies, and connecting it to my NAS via NFS for persistent storage where needed.
Why do you want a K8s cluster at home?</description>

      <description>This post is long overdue, at this point Matt, Turk, and myself took this trip almost a year ago now. Better late than never I suppose, I&amp;rsquo;ll still be updating pictures here and there, but I wanted to get this post out!
Day 1, Travel The trip started out quite amazing, it was my first flight on JetSuiteX, and airline that opened its door to the public for its charter flights 1 year prior.</description>

      <description>Sometimes owning a home can be a real pain, this is especially true when you learn that the previous owner was bad at DIY projects. I happen to be in that situation! As much as I love my home, and in all honesty haven&amp;rsquo;t had any severe trouble, I do get frustrated when I see things that look like the previous owner listened to advice from a friend of a friend who claimed he knew a thing or two about electrical work.</description>

      <description>Prepare for a boring post about blog software!
Heya Folks! I decided to try out a new blog software, I found myself wanting to write posts in something more MarkDown like, and Wordpress didn&amp;rsquo;t have very many good options for a MD editor with proper syntax highlighting. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot of MD for our git repos at Tigera, and code examples on Slack, and other places. I did some digging and came very close to grabbing Jekyll, but after some research I ended up landing on Hexo.</description>

      <description>So I recently entered into the amazing world of 3D printing, my wife bought me an Ultimaker 2+ for my birthday this year! It has been a fascinating experience and a whole can of worms I never even knew existed. I will say, the Ultimaker series is supposed to be the most &amp;ldquo;plug it in and print&amp;rdquo; printer out there (or at least among the top in that group) but there was still quite a learning curve and there was a lot of tuning involved.</description>

      <description>Day 1 As with most trips, we started by flying out to our starting destination, Denver Colorado. The flight out was mostly uneventful, and we got into Denver on time to go pickup the Bikes we rented from Eagle Rider. We rented some BMW 1200GS bikes to take us on our journey through the Rockies.
We rode out of Denver shortly after 5pm first stopping at the auto parts store to pickup tire patch kits and the grocery store for food for the weekend.</description>

      <description>This last weekend was quite exciting, made some major progress on building our new deck, but this post isn&amp;rsquo;t really about that, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a whole separate post with pictures, timelapse, etc&amp;hellip; once it is done. This post is about watercooled PCs and what happens when they fail!
So, sometime between Friday night and Saturday morning, my watercooler failed. The outlet on the pump (all in one type unit so the pump was on the CPU heatsink) broke off, not really sure how, and sprayed a water/glycol (I think?</description>

      <description>So At home I like to use Debian, well to be honest I use it anywhere I can, but that is aside from the point here.I recently switched my laptop to Debian (came with Ubuntu, finally had enough of Unity) with Cinnamon as the desktop environment. I happily went along just playing around like normal, enjoying the nice DE, and clean looks.
Then one day, I go to install my Java IDE and get rolling on some code.</description>

      <description>Wow, it has been some time since I made any posts. I was recently having some issues with the site and it got me on a security kick as of late. On my server that I host this site out of I run a script that parses through the access logs on my Debian box and looks for invalid login attempts, which appear to be dictionary attacks, checking for default logins and common passwords based on the login names they are trying to use.</description>

      <description>Well it has been awhile since I posted last, lots of fun stuff going on but I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to keep it short. As I know some of the very few people who read this do not like walls of text, you know who you are&amp;hellip;
So a friend and I have decided to try and spin up a motorcycle show on YouTube in the style of Top Gear (or former Top Gear anyway) where it is mostly a satire of reviews, but not completely, if that makes sense?</description>

      <description>Well I&amp;rsquo;ve settled into my position at Dell now, and am starting to finally make some real changes now. We use a scheduling and automation suite here from a 3rd party that is pretty awesome, at least from a users perspective. The administration side of it feels like an afterthought in comparison, and it might be as they have a fairly extensive API to bang against, but it is an XML-RPC API, and not even a standard one so I cannot use the Python XML-RPC libs to get the job done.</description>

      <description>Well, today was a day worth posting. I suppose it technically started last night when I got a call from the dealership that my bike is on consignment for, being that it was late I just ignored it in my half dozed state and went to sleep. Little did I know that apparently my Kawasaki had been stolen! I checked the voicemail before I headed out to work in the morning, and got the news, and shortly after called the guy at the dealership, who is a wonderfully nice guy I should add, gave him some missing info for the police report and went on my day.</description>

      <description>Well it has been quite an exciting couple weeks. Got a new motorcycle, Cousin got married, making waves at the new job, built a new fence and tore down the old one, and played some Diablo! Well that last point isn&amp;rsquo;t very exciting, but I like that game and a friend just picked it up so I played a bit with him.
We started doing some landscaping at the house this last weekend, there was an old crufty fence that blocked off some of the stupid amount of RV parking we had.</description>

      <description>Well it is almost the end of the week, I had some time before I get my day rolling in the office so I thought it would be a good time to do a thought dump while having my coffee.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been here for almost 2 weeks now, really starting to settle in and make this place feel like home. It is kind of weird not dreading going into the office every day.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wrapped up my first week at the new Job, working on process control and automation for our research and development labs. I spent most of my week getting up to speed, as is the case with most new jobs. I have been able to make at least some contributions in my first week, but it will be some time until I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve made a real impact. The lab team was recently brought under the umbrella of IT, like in the past 2-3 months, and it is obviously making waves, and causing some slow down, but in my opinion it will be a change for the good as they will be able to benefit more from the IT side tools and people more than they would have before, but as with any major change it is slowing things down initially as people adjust.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re not even engaged for a week and she has already setup the venue, dates, and we have the wedding party planned, things are a movin! It was nice to have most of our friends and some of our family around for the event, I managed to keep it a secret from basically everyone.</description>

      <description>Well it has been awhile since the layoffs at Riverbed, I&amp;rsquo;ve had many an interview but I was finally extended a formal offer, and the other two places that I had in mind fizzled out, so I&amp;rsquo;ll likely be taking this. The unfortunate part is I will be commuting down to San Jose from Concord again, in the end it isn&amp;rsquo;t horrible, I have some folks I will carpool with as they work down the road, so it will almost be like public transit!</description>

      <description>Well is has been a fun week, and more fun to come. I did several phone screens last week that have landed me face-to-face interviews. It is some exciting stuff and there are two places that I am really, really hoping work out. I had to kick my JavaEE application server administration knowledge into high gear though. In the past I have done some basic administration on Tomcat and Glassfish servers, but never any really deep dives into the tech.</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s Friday! Yay! We&amp;rsquo;ve had an interesting week here in our new home. Last week our kitchen lights decided to go out, all at the same time, so electrical issue not bulb issues. We called out the electrician who ran some new circuits to the office for us, and he came out almost immediately and gave us a temporary fix (as this was Friday night at like 6pm) so we had lights until he came back on Wednesday.</description>

      <description>Well it has been a crazy week. We finalized the paperwork on a new house, which we will be moving into soon now, and within the same week I was laid off from my job in a large downsizing effort at Riverbed. This is an unfortunate turn of events, but I was given 2.5 months of severance to get back on my feet, and have already had a couple of good phone interviews.</description>

      <description>We have finally released our game over at Iridium Flare Games, it is a fun little endless runner with 100% original, hand crafted graphics and code. If you are an Android user you should check it out and let us know how you like it, you can find it on the Play Store as Ogre Simulator. It was a long and strange journey, we basically had no idea what we were doing, even though we had already worked on another title, that is still in progress, and every time we set a deadline we failed to meet it.</description>

      <description>Some time back I lent a friend a book on Java programming, with the hopes that he would pick it up and eventually lend us a hand with our games. He did enjoy it, went through the standard hazings that you do as a programmer, getting SDKs setup, environmental variables registered, learning how important a semicolon is, and so on. Not too long after my manager started talking about that we wanted to open a Junior position on the team.</description>

      <description>So a couple years ago I started teaching myself programming, there was a lot of bumps along the way, and knowing what I know now I probably would have done things much differently, but isn&amp;rsquo;t that always the case. Anyway, back then I started with Python and Perl as they were relevant to what I was trying to do in my sysadmin work, but quickly branched out to Java, C/C++, and tinkered in some other languages.</description>

      <description>Well I decided to create a personal blog to do my daily thought dump and wanted to keep it off of our main site, iridiumflaregames.com, as a lot of this may or may not pertain to things that are going on with the company. Plus swarming the content with things completely unrelated to games or the company might not be the best thing, but I will probably cross post a lot of stuff from site to site.</description>
