    <h1 class="title"> Another week almost done, and some new toys on the horizon </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Well it is almost the end of the week, I had some time before I get my day rolling in the office so I thought it would be a good time to do a thought dump while having my coffee.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been here for almost 2 weeks now, really starting to settle in and make this place feel like home.  It is kind of weird not dreading going into the office every day.  I won&rsquo;t say I look forward to it, but I&rsquo;m at least not having to convince myself to get up and start my day.  I haven&rsquo;t made a huge impact here yet, but hopefully I can start changing that today.  Our infrastructure in the labs is pretty abysmal, which isn&rsquo;t uncommon for R&amp;D labs, but I want to get it up to par and manageable.  Since IT and my team are both under the same manager we are going to see what services we want to bring in from their side, and which we want to create our own of.</p>

<p>My gut feel is that the lab should maintain their own infrastructure, but to be honest I don&rsquo;t have a valid reason for why other than it is the way I have done it in the past.  One could argue security or availability to separate them, but our IT department isn&rsquo;t maintaining all of the IT world wide, it is local, and the legacy stuff from a previously acquired company (which is in the same space as the labs) so it won&rsquo;t touch the larger company as a whole.  Either way it will be good to get some services in the lab, as we are currently lacking almost all basic services (DNS, DHCP, NIS, Centralized vSphere management) and I hope that I can help change that.</p>

<p>In other news I test rode a bunch of motorcycles last weekend, and I&rsquo;ve decided which one I would like to purchase, so now it is just a matter of seeing if and for how much I can trade my old bike in and if they will finance me for enough money to pickup one.  I was considering going this weekend, but I think I might wait until I&rsquo;ve paid off some other credit I had to open recently for reasons.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to get some programming done this weekend as well, been putting off working on stuff.  I really need to finish my Android book so I can start tinkering with some apps.  I&rsquo;d like to create something for work that lets me hook up to our equipment DB with a REST API so I can setup an app to query it and get the info needed for console, location, etc. while walking around the labs, and maybe even push updates.</p>

<p>I really wish I had more time in the day and more motivation, it seems that I have all of these things I want to learn and do, but when it comes to actually doing it I start to fall behind where I would like to be.  Need to work on that&hellip;</p>
