    <div class="content"> <p>Well it has been awhile since I posted last, lots of fun stuff going on but I&rsquo;m going to try to keep it short.  As I know some of the very few people who read this do not like walls of text, you know who you are&hellip;</p>

<p>So a friend and I have decided to try and spin up a motorcycle show on YouTube in the style of Top Gear (or former Top Gear anyway) where it is mostly a satire of reviews, but not completely, if that makes sense?  It&rsquo;ll mostly be fun to watch with some informative talks, but mostly just fun, light hearted humor.  I&rsquo;ll be sure to post some updates when we get an episode posted.</p>

<p>We lost our intern at the office last week, which made me sad, he was a good guy and was the only one I got to talk shop with in regards to programming.  He will be going on to bigger and better things when he graduates, I only wish him good things to come.  Hopefully we open some new positions on the team soon though, as he did take care of some rack-and-stack work for us too, and that is piling up quick.</p>

<p>Zac and I are trying to get back around to making some new stuff happen in Rabbots, it is more than slow going though as I have kinda lost my drive.  Not the first time, and probably won&rsquo;t be the last, but hopefully I can find it again and get rolling on this.  I&rsquo;d like to get a real, quality game out and have people play it.  Stupid life getting in the way, why can&rsquo;t I just make money doing nothing so I can get better at game development!  Oh well, at least I am working towards that goal.</p>

<p>On that note LibGDX has been getting better and better, so hopefully I can make full use of it to do some awesome things.  I need to push past the boring parts of our game, like collision detection, so I can get back to making awesome features.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s long enough!  Thanks for reading!</p>
