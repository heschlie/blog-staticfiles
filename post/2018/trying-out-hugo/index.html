<h1 id="trying-out-hugo-for-the-blog">Trying out Hugo for the blog</h1>

<p>Well I have had my eye on Hugo, a static site generator for some time now.
It is written in Go, supports markdown, has a rich theme system, and as
it says it generates html you can just drop in for nginx or whatever
your webserver happens to be.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using hexo for some time now, and it has worked quite well,
but I&rsquo;m not fond of managing the Node dependencies, and I don&rsquo;t know
Javascript all too well so I wanted something that was both open source
and written in a language I knew and could more easily contribute to. and
on top of that, Hugo is blazingly fast.</p>

<h2 id="migrating-off-hexo-to-hugo">Migrating off Hexo to Hugo</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started to get a grip on how things work in Hugo, the documentation isn&rsquo;t
the easiest to grok, but thankfully it has a thriving community, so it is
pretty easy to sort out what you need to do when converting.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to migrate from Hexo. There
wasn&rsquo;t a conversion tool like there are for some other platforms, but since
Hexo is a Markdown generated site as well, you really only need to update
shortcodes. With my site I had really only used a few for Youtube videos, and
Hexo had one for images that I used instead of Markdown. With that in mind it
was pretty easy to just write a regex to find one short code and convert it
to either Markdown or the new shortcode. The only catch with the images was
the alt-text. I put a placeholder in and adjusted it where I felt like it.</p>

<p>The regex I used in VSCode:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">^<span style="color:#ed9d13">\{\%</span> asset_img (.*) <span style="color:#ed9d13">\%\}</span>$
![alt-text](/static/dir/path/<span style="color:#40ffff">$1</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>I only had a handful of posts I needed to update so I just went through them
in VSCode which the find/replace allows you to use a regex and supports capture
groups, obviously replace the <code>/static/dir/path/</code> with the actual path to the
image.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a strong opinion on static site generators, but I like Hugo so
far. I had considered moving to it some time back but got the impression
using it as a blog would be less than ideal, not sure what gave me said idea
as it works great!</p>

<h2 id="publishing-content">Publishing content</h2>

<p>I was never a fan of how Hexo went about publishing. There is no reason I
couldn&rsquo;t have just generated the content and pushed it on my own, but for
whatever reason I tried to stay in the ecosystem. Hugo, comes with no
opinion on how to publish. Since I host my own webserver for stuff like this
I simply generate the content, and use rsync to push the data to the right
place.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">rm -rf public/ &amp;&amp; hugo &amp;&amp; rsync -avz --delete public/* blog.heschlie.com:/path/to/blog/</code></pre></div>
<p>Once I am ready to publish I run that (from a makefile cause why not) via
<code>make publish</code> and thanks to the beauty of ssh, I&rsquo;m not even prompted
for a password, quick and simple, and keeps the generated files out of
the git repo, and no messing around with deployment options in the config.</p>

<h2 id="rss-feeds">RSS feeds</h2>

<p>This one took me a minute to sort out, it turns out it was already generating
the RSS xml files, they just weren&rsquo;t where I thought it would be. I&rsquo;m used
to the site having an <code>atom.xml</code> or <code>rss.xml</code> on the root of the project.
What I was actually looking for was called <code>index.xml</code>, but it wasn&rsquo;t the one
at the root directory that I needed. Hugo is a bit more clever and will
generate an xml for each section, so you can watch parts of the site
independently. For instance, I was looking for <a href="https://blog.heschlie.com/post/index.xml">https://blog.heschlie.com/post/index.xml</a> to point my automation at</p>

<h2 id="final-ish-thoughts">Final&hellip;ish thoughts</h2>

<p>I like it so far, only took me a couple hours to convert my posts over. I did
loose my Disqus posts, but there were like&hellip;3? Apologies if yours was one of
them. I could probably map the new posts over to the old ones for Disqus to
find but I&rsquo;m not sure it is worth it.</p>

<p>I really like that the Hugo is just a single binary (thanks Golang!) and has a
pretty clean CLI. I always had trouble setting Hexo back up when changing to
a new machine, Hugo is just grab the binary, clone the repo, start editing.</p>
