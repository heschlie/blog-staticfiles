      <description>Prepare for a boring post about blog software!
Heya Folks! I decided to try out a new blog software, I found myself wanting to write posts in something more MarkDown like, and Wordpress didn&amp;rsquo;t have very many good options for a MD editor with proper syntax highlighting. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot of MD for our git repos at Tigera, and code examples on Slack, and other places. I did some digging and came very close to grabbing Jekyll, but after some research I ended up landing on Hexo.</description>

      <description>This last weekend was quite exciting, made some major progress on building our new deck, but this post isn&amp;rsquo;t really about that, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a whole separate post with pictures, timelapse, etc&amp;hellip; once it is done. This post is about watercooled PCs and what happens when they fail!
So, sometime between Friday night and Saturday morning, my watercooler failed. The outlet on the pump (all in one type unit so the pump was on the CPU heatsink) broke off, not really sure how, and sprayed a water/glycol (I think?</description>

      <description>Wow, it has been some time since I made any posts. I was recently having some issues with the site and it got me on a security kick as of late. On my server that I host this site out of I run a script that parses through the access logs on my Debian box and looks for invalid login attempts, which appear to be dictionary attacks, checking for default logins and common passwords based on the login names they are trying to use.</description>

      <title>Creating APIs and frameworks (no code, just talk)</title>

      <description>Well I&amp;rsquo;ve settled into my position at Dell now, and am starting to finally make some real changes now. We use a scheduling and automation suite here from a 3rd party that is pretty awesome, at least from a users perspective. The administration side of it feels like an afterthought in comparison, and it might be as they have a fairly extensive API to bang against, but it is an XML-RPC API, and not even a standard one so I cannot use the Python XML-RPC libs to get the job done.</description>

      <description>Well it is almost the end of the week, I had some time before I get my day rolling in the office so I thought it would be a good time to do a thought dump while having my coffee.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been here for almost 2 weeks now, really starting to settle in and make this place feel like home. It is kind of weird not dreading going into the office every day.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wrapped up my first week at the new Job, working on process control and automation for our research and development labs. I spent most of my week getting up to speed, as is the case with most new jobs. I have been able to make at least some contributions in my first week, but it will be some time until I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve made a real impact. The lab team was recently brought under the umbrella of IT, like in the past 2-3 months, and it is obviously making waves, and causing some slow down, but in my opinion it will be a change for the good as they will be able to benefit more from the IT side tools and people more than they would have before, but as with any major change it is slowing things down initially as people adjust.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re not even engaged for a week and she has already setup the venue, dates, and we have the wedding party planned, things are a movin! It was nice to have most of our friends and some of our family around for the event, I managed to keep it a secret from basically everyone.</description>

      <description>Well is has been a fun week, and more fun to come. I did several phone screens last week that have landed me face-to-face interviews. It is some exciting stuff and there are two places that I am really, really hoping work out. I had to kick my JavaEE application server administration knowledge into high gear though. In the past I have done some basic administration on Tomcat and Glassfish servers, but never any really deep dives into the tech.</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s Friday! Yay! We&amp;rsquo;ve had an interesting week here in our new home. Last week our kitchen lights decided to go out, all at the same time, so electrical issue not bulb issues. We called out the electrician who ran some new circuits to the office for us, and he came out almost immediately and gave us a temporary fix (as this was Friday night at like 6pm) so we had lights until he came back on Wednesday.</description>

      <description>Some time back I lent a friend a book on Java programming, with the hopes that he would pick it up and eventually lend us a hand with our games. He did enjoy it, went through the standard hazings that you do as a programmer, getting SDKs setup, environmental variables registered, learning how important a semicolon is, and so on. Not too long after my manager started talking about that we wanted to open a Junior position on the team.</description>
