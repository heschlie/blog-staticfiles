      <description>A Followup on the CR10S S5 So I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with the printer for about a week now. All of my planned upgrades have come in and some of them ended up not needing to be upgrades, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more in detail about that below. For those not wanting to read the whole article, the short of it is I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much dialed in the settings with the new extruder/hotend using 3mm filament, and I am impressed with the results.</description>
