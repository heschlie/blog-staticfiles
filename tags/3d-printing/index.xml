      <description>A Followup on the CR10S S5 So I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with the printer for about a week now. All of my planned upgrades have come in and some of them ended up not needing to be upgrades, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more in detail about that below. For those not wanting to read the whole article, the short of it is I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much dialed in the settings with the new extruder/hotend using 3mm filament, and I am impressed with the results.</description>

      <description>A brief overview of the CR10S-S5 Recently I decided one 3D printer was just not enough. I have no complaints about my first printer, an Ultimaker 2+, it creates some beautiful prints and does them quickly as well. However, I do every so often want to print bigger, which means multiple pieces and glue. So I had been keeping an eye out for a decent quality large volume printer, and my dreams came true!</description>

      <description>So I recently entered into the amazing world of 3D printing, my wife bought me an Ultimaker 2+ for my birthday this year! It has been a fascinating experience and a whole can of worms I never even knew existed. I will say, the Ultimaker series is supposed to be the most &amp;ldquo;plug it in and print&amp;rdquo; printer out there (or at least among the top in that group) but there was still quite a learning curve and there was a lot of tuning involved.</description>
