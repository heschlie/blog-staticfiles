      <description>Trying out Hugo for the blog Well I have had my eye on Hugo, a static site generator for some time now. It is written in Go, supports markdown, has a rich theme system, and as it says it generates html you can just drop in for nginx or whatever your webserver happens to be.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using hexo for some time now, and it has worked quite well, but I&amp;rsquo;m not fond of managing the Node dependencies, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know Javascript all too well so I wanted something that was both open source and written in a language I knew and could more easily contribute to.</description>
