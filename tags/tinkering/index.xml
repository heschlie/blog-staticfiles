      <description>A Followup on the CR10S S5 So I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with the printer for about a week now. All of my planned upgrades have come in and some of them ended up not needing to be upgrades, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more in detail about that below. For those not wanting to read the whole article, the short of it is I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much dialed in the settings with the new extruder/hotend using 3mm filament, and I am impressed with the results.</description>

      <description>A brief overview of the CR10S-S5 Recently I decided one 3D printer was just not enough. I have no complaints about my first printer, an Ultimaker 2+, it creates some beautiful prints and does them quickly as well. However, I do every so often want to print bigger, which means multiple pieces and glue. So I had been keeping an eye out for a decent quality large volume printer, and my dreams came true!</description>
