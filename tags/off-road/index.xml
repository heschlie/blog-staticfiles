      <description>Day 1 As with most trips, we started by flying out to our starting destination, Denver Colorado. The flight out was mostly uneventful, and we got into Denver on time to go pickup the Bikes we rented from Eagle Rider. We rented some BMW 1200GS bikes to take us on our journey through the Rockies.
We rode out of Denver shortly after 5pm first stopping at the auto parts store to pickup tire patch kits and the grocery store for food for the weekend.</description>
