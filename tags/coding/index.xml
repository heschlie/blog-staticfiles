      <description>Prepare for a boring post about blog software!
Heya Folks! I decided to try out a new blog software, I found myself wanting to write posts in something more MarkDown like, and Wordpress didn&amp;rsquo;t have very many good options for a MD editor with proper syntax highlighting. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot of MD for our git repos at Tigera, and code examples on Slack, and other places. I did some digging and came very close to grabbing Jekyll, but after some research I ended up landing on Hexo.</description>

      <description>So a couple years ago I started teaching myself programming, there was a lot of bumps along the way, and knowing what I know now I probably would have done things much differently, but isn&amp;rsquo;t that always the case. Anyway, back then I started with Python and Perl as they were relevant to what I was trying to do in my sysadmin work, but quickly branched out to Java, C/C++, and tinkered in some other languages.</description>
