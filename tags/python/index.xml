      <description>Well I&amp;rsquo;ve settled into my position at Dell now, and am starting to finally make some real changes now. We use a scheduling and automation suite here from a 3rd party that is pretty awesome, at least from a users perspective. The administration side of it feels like an afterthought in comparison, and it might be as they have a fairly extensive API to bang against, but it is an XML-RPC API, and not even a standard one so I cannot use the Python XML-RPC libs to get the job done.</description>

      <description>So a couple years ago I started teaching myself programming, there was a lot of bumps along the way, and knowing what I know now I probably would have done things much differently, but isn&amp;rsquo;t that always the case. Anyway, back then I started with Python and Perl as they were relevant to what I was trying to do in my sysadmin work, but quickly branched out to Java, C/C++, and tinkered in some other languages.</description>
