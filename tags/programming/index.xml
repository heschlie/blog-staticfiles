      <description>We have finally released our game over at Iridium Flare Games, it is a fun little endless runner with 100% original, hand crafted graphics and code. If you are an Android user you should check it out and let us know how you like it, you can find it on the Play Store as Ogre Simulator. It was a long and strange journey, we basically had no idea what we were doing, even though we had already worked on another title, that is still in progress, and every time we set a deadline we failed to meet it.</description>

      <description>So a couple years ago I started teaching myself programming, there was a lot of bumps along the way, and knowing what I know now I probably would have done things much differently, but isn&amp;rsquo;t that always the case. Anyway, back then I started with Python and Perl as they were relevant to what I was trying to do in my sysadmin work, but quickly branched out to Java, C/C++, and tinkered in some other languages.</description>
